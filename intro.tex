  \frametitle{What is probability theory?}

  Probability theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with throwing dices and flipping coins (and a few other things too).\\

  \begin{exampleblock}{Example}
    I throw a fair $6$-faced dice a million times. Can I say anything interesting \emph{a priori}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item About the outcome of the $10000$th throw?
    \item About the number of times i'll get a $6$?
    \item About the average of all numbers I got?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{exampleblock}

  
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Why a theory of probabilities?}
  
  \begin{block}{Nondeterminism}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Modelling \emph{Random} phenomena or \emph{trials}: when `repeated' trials yield different outcomes, \emph{i.e.} the outcome \emph{fluctuates}.
    \item Typical examples from before: throwing a dice, flipping a coin.
    \item But not only: playing roulette, running a processor at a certain speed (may crash or not), having $n$ radioactive element disintegrate in a given amount of time, transmitting a message through a faulty device...
    \item Draw conclusions, make prediction about outcomes and how much they can \emph{fluctuate}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why a theory of probabilities (contd)?}
  Which of the following game would you rather play:
  
  \begin{exampleblock}{Example 1.}
    You throw two $6$ faces fair dices thus obtain two numbers $a$ and $b$, and win $ab-5$ euros.
  \end{exampleblock}

  \begin{exampleblock}{Example 2.}
    You throw one $6$ face dice and obtain a number $a$. If $a$ is odd you win $a$ euros. Otherwise you throw a second dice, obtain a number $b$ and win $2b$ euros.
  \end{exampleblock}

\begin{frame}
  
  \begin{block}{Uncertainty and incomplete knowledge.}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Probabilities as a mean to measure \emph{degrees} of uncertainty.
    \item Guide rational decisions under uncertainty (work of Von Neunmann, Nash, \dots).
    \item No need to even \emph{believe} in non-determinism:
    \item probabilities as a view of the mind abstracting over unknown/too numerous/unmeasurable factors influencing a deterministic outcome.
    \item getting a simple and manageable approximation, allowing to draw conclusions and make predictions.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Probabilities and language.}
  For a thorough treatment of this topic see [Manning \& Sch\"utze, \emph{Foundations of Natural Language Processing.}]. Here are a couple points borrowed from there: 

  \begin{block}{Different possible expressions are not equally likely}
    Language use is best described accounting for the \emph{likelihood} of people to chose an expression over another.
  \end{block}

  \begin{exampleblock}{Convention}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[a)] I did not shoot the deputy.
    \item[b)] I did not fire my gun on the deputy and peirce him with a bullet.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Probabilities and language (contd).}
  
  \begin{block}{Degrees vs. categorical judgements.}
    In some cases, binary linguistics judgmnents (veracity, grammaticality) are hard to carry, and easier to model on a continuous scale.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item what are truth conditions for adjectives like \emph{bald} or \emph{red}?
    \end{itemize}
    {\bf Moreover, \emph{continuous} models such as offered by probability theory have exploitable mathematical property that discrete models lack.}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Ambiguity.}
    Ambiguity is present at every level of language, so that systematically asking for disambiguisation, or always entertaining all options would not be manageable.
  \end{block}
